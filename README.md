![Usage](misc/usage.jpg)

**As you can see there are two required parameters *'hotel_name'* and *'country'*. In order to get the hotel_name do the following:**

1. Go to Booking.com
2. Search your hotel by name. Lets say you searched 'Paramount Hotel Times Square'. Now go to hotel page.
3. Now you are on the hotel page. Get the url of this hotel page from the browser. In the current example you should have something like this "https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/paramount-new-york.en-gb.html..."
4. From this url, get the string that is betweeen 'en-gb.html' and '/us/'. In this case it is **'paramount-new-york'**. This will be the value of **hotel_name** parameter. 
5. **'us'** is the value of the **country** parameter. You can use it from here or simply visit https://www.iban.com/country-codes and copy the alpha-2 code of your desired country.


Here are some examples:

```bash
python python run.py 'paramount-new-york' 'us'
```
The above command will scrape all the reviews till the end. (default sort_by option 'most_relevant' will be used)

```bash
python run.py 'paramount-new-york' 'us' --sort-by 'newest_first' --n-reviews 20
```
The above command with sort the reviews by 'newest_first' and then scrape the top 20 reviews


```bash
python run.py 'paramount-new-york' 'us' --stop-criteria-username 'Mr.Nice' --stop-criteria-review-title 'It's a good choice. Generally comfy and location-wise.'
```
The above command will only stop scraping when the mentioned username with review_title is found.  (default sort_by option 'most_relevant' will be used)
